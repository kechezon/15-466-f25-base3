How To Play:
- WASD: Move
- Listen for the bell chimes: they tell you the location of a Chime Bomb that will explode in four beats.
- Your goal is to avoid the explosions and survive to the end of the song.

Strategies and Advanced Play:
- Make a mental map of the Chime Bombs as you hear them, and preemptively avoid those areas even before the visual cue shows up.
- Having trouble dodging? Focus on the more complex melodic ideas rather than the basslines or ostenatos.
- Think you know the stage well? Prove your mastery with a high FACE Score! FACE stands for "Flying A-lotta Close to Explosions."
